#+title: Greetd Framebuffer login manager
#+subtitle: formerly Deathowl's dummy login manager

A minimal graphical login manager.
Uses framebuffer, so You wont have to run a wayland session to bootstrap your wayland session
This is a greetd frontend.

* Prior work
Continuation/fork of prior work by [[https://github.com/deathowl/ddlm][Deathowl]] and [[https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/dlm][kenylevinsen]].
This fork hopes to expand the tool giving it more functionality, while keeping it minimalistic.

* Setup
My greetd config looks like:
#+BEGIN_SRC
[terminal]
# The VT to run the greeter on. Can be "next", "current" or a number
# designating the VT.
vt = "current"

# The default session, also known as the greeter.
[default_session]

command = "fblm"

# The user to run the command as. The privileges this user must have depends
# on the greeter. A graphical greeter may for example require the user to be
# in the `video` group.
user = "greetd"
#+END_SRC
